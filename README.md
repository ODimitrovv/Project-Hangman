Rules: You have six lifes - HP. Every character guessed
gets written in the console and every character that
hasn`t been guessed yet is not shown and on its place
there is a underdash. For every wrong guess a man getting
hanged gets drawn on the console, when you lose all your
HP the game stops and tells you the word. Game can be played
